To install the development version of the ptcn package from GitHub, please clone the repo and perform the following steps:

Install Python <=3.7 (https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3710/) and Anaconda (https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/). 

Open the Anaconda terminal or local machines terminal. 
If you choose your local machine make sure to change the directory to the pathway of your python.exe to ensure any modules installed are directed properly. 
Install the following modules: 

* pip install tensorflow==1.15 or conda install tensorflow==1.15
* pip install keras
* pip install re
* pip install nltk & nltk.download('punkt')
* pip install os
* pip install pandas
* pip install numpy
* pip install stop_words
* pip install sklearn

Optionally you can unsleep the lines #() in script 'install.packages.r' to install the modules in python because the package reticulate enables the connection between R and Python to communicate commands.  

Install R <=3.5 and Rstudio. 
To Install R  <=3.5 follow the link https://cran.r-project.org/bin/ and select the correct OS from the directory lists on the webpage. Locate a version 3.5 or less and install it. 

* https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/old/3.5.0/
* https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/R-3.3.3.pkg

Open a R session and set the working directory to the cloned folder. 
Open the 'install.packages.r' script to install the dependency packages for the course. 
Note, some of the packages will be installed from source files stored in the 'packages' folder.
