# Classification of Congressional Votes

[Academic paper](./paper) and [code embodiment](./code) for evaluating votes in the US Congress.

## Tabula Rasa

The below steps can be taken to "re-play" the project's process.
Each step may refer to a different README.
In these cases, the step in that README will aslo be noted.
It is recommended you read the full README as sometimes a step may contain a shortcut or other prior assumed knowledge.

When the work is still _in-progress_ a note of TODO, DOING, DONE should be added to the front

01. Get the data.
    [Data instructions](./data) (step 1-3)
02. Analyse the text.
    [Code instructions](./code)
03. Knit the paper.
    [Paper instructions](./paper)

## Environment

Tensor Flow is super fickle when it comes to setup.
The code used in this paper uses the v1 guidance found [here](https://github.com/MindMimicLabs/getting-started/blob/master/setup-your-environment.md)
