"what's his name again? howard, isn't it?" "harry
"how did you know it was me?" she asked
would you care for a lemon drop?" "a what?" "a lemon drop
"what did you say?" his aunt snapped through the door
"and come back and find the house in ruins?" she snarled
"dudley! mr. dursley! come and look at this snake! you won't believe what it's doing!" dudley came waddling toward them as fast as he could
i want my letter!" he shouted
"who's writing to me?" "no one
"found the perfect place!" he said
"who's there?" he shouted
"i warn you  i'm armed!" there was a pause
"an' here's harry!" said the giant
i demand that you leave at once, sit!" he said
"now wait jus' one second!" he had leapt to his feet
"dursley!" he boomed
"what? my  my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?" "yeh don' know
"stop! i forbid you!" yelled uncle vernon in panic
" a what?" gasped harry
"hagrid!" said harry loudly
"knuts?" "the little bronze ones
"um  hagrid?" "mm?" said hagrid, who was pulling on his huge boots
"wizards have banks?" "just the one
"flew?" "yeah  but we'll go back in this
"told yeh, didn't i? told yeh you was famous
"is he always that nervous?" "oh, yeah
"have you got your own broom?" the boy went on
"do you?" said the boy, with a slight sneer
"why is he with you? where are your parents?" "they're dead," said harry shortly
"what's up?" said hagrid
"rubeus! rubeus hagrid! how nice to see you again
"first time at hogwarts? ron's new, too
"you know that black-haired boy who was near us in the station? know who he is?" "who?" "harry potter!" harry heard the little girl's voice

"george!" "only joking, mom

"bleaaargh  see? sprouts
"oh, are you doing magic? let's see it, then
"are you sure that's a real spell?" said the girl
"are you really?" said hermione
"is it true?" he said
so it's you, is it?" "yes," said harry
"he's a genius! best wizard in the world! but he is a bit mad, yes
"ouch!" harry clapped a hand to his head
"what is it?" asked percy
"where?" "next to the tall kid with the red hair
"rubbish!" said hagrid
"what is a wizard's duel?" said harry
"can't a person eat in peace in this place?" said ron
"shut up, both of you!" said harry sharply
"mrs. norris?" breathed ron, squinting through the dark
"how's your arm?" said harry
"which way did they go, peeves?" filch was saying
perhaps snape had left the book in there? it was worth a try
no sign of the snitch yet, eh?" "nope," said ron
down in the stands, dean thomas was yelling, "send him off, ref! red card!" "what are you talking about, dean?" said ron
"what should we do?" "leave it to me
"how do you know about fluffy?" he said
"weird!" he said, 'nmat a shape! this is money?" "you can keep it," said harry, laughing at how pleased ron was
"it is! look down!" harry looked down at his feet, but they were gone
"who's there?" squawked the fat lady
"dad?" they just looked at him, smiling
who cared what the three headed dog was guarding? what did it matter if snape stole it, really? "are you all right?" said ron
"no!" harry hissed
"want to play chess, harry?" said ron
does that help?" harry thought
"the what?" said harry and ron
"ron! ron! where are you? the game's over! harry's won! we've won! gryffindor is in the lead!" shrieked hermione, dancing up and down on her seat and hugging parvati patil in the row in front
"bless him, look, he knows his mommy!" said hagrid
charlie can take care of him and then put him back in the wild!" "brilliant!" said ron
"snape's done it, then!" said ron
"but we've got no proof!" said harry
"who's there?" hagrid called
can you ride? it will be quicker this way
"what are you doing? you have a human on your back! have you no shame? are you a common mule?" "do you realize who this is?" said firenze
"what have you been telling him?" growled bane
"why's bane so angry?" he asked
"will you stop saying the name!" ron hissed
"i shouldn'ta told yeh that!" he blurted out
"i'm sorry, harry!" she wailed
"well, that's it then, isn't it?" harry said
"you can't!" said hermione
"but will it cover all three of us?" said ron
"want to go first, hermione?" "no, i don't!" "all right
"what's this stuff?" were his first words
"do you think it's a ghost?" "i don't know
yes  look! broomsticks! we've got to catch the key to the door!" "but there are hundreds of them!" ron examined the lock on the door
"that one!" he called to the others
"that's chess!" snapped ron
"you!" gasped harry
"but snape tried to kill me!" "no, no, no
is the stone inside the mirror? should i break it?" harry's mind was racing
"tell me the truth! what did you just see?" the high voice spoke again
what was going on? the turban fell away
"see what i have become?" the face said
"how long have i been in here?" "three days
"what?" "he saved his life
"d'you think he meant you to do it?" said ron
"yeh could've died!" sobbed hagrid
"busy year?" she said
"i meant `please'!" said harry quickly
"muuuum! he's doing you know what!" harry paid dearly for his moment of fun
"oh - really?" said harry
"why?" said harry in surprise
"see what it's like here?" he said
"go on - read it!" harry took it
"all right, harry?" asked george
"what's been going on?" said ron
"what, you think he was lying to me?" said harry
"it was cloudy, mum!" said fred
"your quidditch team?" said harry
"never?" said mr. weasley
"i'm just -" "harry! what d'yeh think yer doin' down there?" harry's heart leapt
"i can see it!" harry yelled
"what have you done with the car?" ron gulped
"what's the matter?" said harry
"what's a howler?" he said
"yes?" he smiled at seamus
is it easy? is that your own broom? is that the best one there is?" harry didn't know how to get rid of him
"i booked it!" ** "ah," said flint
"he didn'!" he growled at hermione
"what?" he said loudly
"that voice!" "sorry?" said lockhart, looking puzzled
"and lockhart said he couldn't hear it?" said ron
"it was only a bit of mud!" said harry
"harry! harry! did it work?" nearly headless nick came gliding out of a classroom
"she haunts a toilet?" "yes
"can we move? i feel sick," said ron
"and what on earth's a squib?" said harry
"why do you want it?" said harry
"what's that?" said harry quickly
"here - and here -" "come and look at this!" said hermione
"no," said harry, "have you, ron? ron?" he looked over his shoulder
"what's up?" said harry
"what's the matter?" said harry
"that's a girls' bathroom!" he gasped
"excuse me?" said ron sharply
"what're you doing here?" he said
"it was you!" he said slowly
"what d'you mean, your bludger? you made that bludger try and kill me?" "not kill you, sir, never kill you!" said dobby, shocked
"silence! silence!" snape roared
"stop! stop!" screamed lockhart, but snape took charge
"three - two - one - go!" he shouted
why didn't you tell us?" "i'm a what?" said harry
"you can talk to snakes!" "i know," said harry
"ready?" he called
"we'll meet you back here, all right?" he said
"eh?" "crabbe holds them sort of stiff
"how's this?" "yeah, that's better
"i beg your pardon?" said the girl stiffly
it's crabbe, isn't it?" "wh - oh, yeah," said ron
"what's the matter?" said ron
"it was a c-cat hair!" she howled
"now what's up with her?" said ron
"what's up, myrtle?" said harry
"are you crazy?" said ron
"harry!" said percy loudly
"he wouldn'! he never!" "stand aside," said riddle, drawing out his wand
"that's dad's boss!" ron breathed
"no!"growled hagrid
"what d'you think it's doing?" said harry
do you know what did kill that girl?" said harry
"what is it?" said harry
"what sort of thing?" he said, coughing
"what were you doing, percy?" said ron, grinning
is fatal to it"! he read aloud
! it all fits!" "but how's the basilisk been getting around the place?" said ron
"not another attack? not now?" "what'll we do?" said ron, aghast
"d'you know what?" said ron
"you wrote them!" harry shouted
"are you okay? ron!" "i'm here!" came ron's muffled voice from behind the rockfall
"did you see -?" he looked up
"what d'you mean?" he said
tom, what am i going to do? i think i'm going mad
"and why did you want to meet me?" said harry
"not what?" snapped riddle
"so. your mother died to save you
"ron!" harry yelled, speeding up
"so!" he said "you've come back
"well?"said mr. malfoy sharply
"don't you want to know how ginny got hold of that diary, mr. malfoy?" said harry
"what's that?" spat mr. malfoy
"when they hear what you did this year?" "proud?" said harry
can you make it? will your aunt and uncle let you come? i really hope you can
"aunt marge?" he blurted out
"what?" harry yelled
"still here, are you?" "yes," said harry
"don't you smirk at me!" boomed aunt marge
"'choo lookin' at?" said stan
"you outta your tree?" yelped stan
"'ear about that 'arry potter? blew up 'is aunt! we 'ad 'im 'ere on the knight bus, di'n't we, ern? 'e was tryin' i to run for it
"how old is this rat?" "dunno," said ron
"they still haven't caught him, then?" he asked
"what's up?" said harry
"what's that?" said hermione
"what d'you mean?" said ron
"ouch!" gasped hermione
"who's that?" "who's that?" "ginny?" "hermione?" "what are you doing?" "i was looking for ron " "come in and sit down " "not here!" said harry hurriedly
"what was that thing?" he asked lupin
"bed rest? should he perhaps spend tonight in the hospital wing?" "i'm fine!" said harry, jumping up
"look at snape!" ron hissed in harry's ear
"where is she?" ron said
"the what?" said harry
"no one?" said hagrid, with a pleading look
"good man, harry!" roared hagrid
"i'm dying, look at me! it's killed me!" "yer not dyin'!" said hagrid, who had gone very white
"how is he?" said ron as they all sat down
"help me!" he moaned to hermione
"where?" said harry and ron quickly
"where is she?" harry turned too
"how did you do that?" said ron
"what?" said hermione, joining them
crack! snape was back
"and the hand!" said dean, waving his own around
the next one might not be for ages " "ron!" said hermione
"oh. but " hermione began
"yes, potter?" harry took a deep breath
"a what?" said harry
"why?" he said again
"why ?" harry began
"did you get any work done?" "no," said harry
"lupin drank it?" he gasped
"is he mad?" hermione checked her watch
"you'll be lucky!" said a cackling voice
"didn't they want to help, sit?" said percy
"\what was all that about?" ron mouthed
what was he doing? why was he flying? he needed to help her
"and?" he said, dreading the answer
"what defenses?" said harry at once
"well, what would you've done?" said fred
"oh, are we?" said george
"are you mad?" said ron, goggling at hermione
"i met him!" growled hagrid
they say he was sobbing, 'lily and james, sirius! how could you?' and then he went for his wand
"like what?" said harry
"you won't, will you, harry?" said hermione
"er  shall i make a cup of tea?" said ron
"oh no!" said ron, his lip twitching
"think that matters to them? they don' care
"who sent it to you?" said ron in a hushed voice
"oh, harry! who sent you that?" "no idea," said harry
"what's the matter with you?" said ron
"listen, harry, can i have a go on it? can i?" "i don't think anyone should ride that broom just yet!" said hermione shrilly
"w  what?" said harry, scrambling to his feet
"what's that?" said harry
stand aside, girl!" "harry!" harry jerked back to life
"are you all right?" said lupin
"go!" said lupin, pulling off the lid
"you heard james?" said lupin in a strange voice
same time next week?" "okay," said harry
"what gives you that idea?" he said sharply
"what  they kill ?" "oh no," said lupin
"you think so?" said lupin lightly
"i can have it back?" harry said weakly
"look!" he yelled, shaking the sheets in her face
"he's gone! and you know what was on the floor?" "n  no," said hermione in a trembling voice
"what's the matter?" said ron
"that's my boy!" wood kept yelling
"yes! yes!" "well done, harry!" said percy, looking delighted
"in our dormitory! with a knife! woke me up!" the common room went very still
"what are they for, hagrid?" said harry
"what about her?" said ron
"harry!" said a voice in his right ear
"'bye!" harry called to ron
"what kept you?" ron hissed
"are you still there? this feels weird
and what is this?" snape had picked up the map
"no!" harry said quickly
"well?" said snape again
"get off, ron!" hermione pulled out her wand
"hermione, why didn't you come to charms?" "what? oh no!" hermione squeaked
"i forgot to go to charms!" "but how could you forget?" said harry
what did this mean? if crookshanks could see the dog as well, how could it be an omen of harry's death? "ron!" harry hissed
"good luck, harry!" called cho
"hello there, harry!" he said
have its head?" "yes," said harry firmly
"no blood? no weeping hagrid?" "no!" said harry again, wanting more than ever to leave the room and the heat
"s  sorry?" said harry
rise again, indeed " ,'but you just said it! you
"where is it?" said hermione
"wan' some tea?" he said
"scabbers!" said ron blankly
"i d  don't believe it  they did it!"
"how  could  they?" she choked
"ron!" hermione moaned
"ron  are you okay?" "where's the dog?" "not a dog," ron moaned
"you never heard her, did you? my mum
"no!" hermione screamed
how could he be with you?" "no one was with us!" said harry
"light again, hermione!" he said
"this place is haunted!" said ron
"didn't you ever hear, ron?" said lupin
"what do you mean?" breathed hermione
"ready, sirius?" said lupin
"thank you! you see, remus? i have never hurt a hair of harry's head! why should i?" "i'll tell you why," said black
"er  mr. black  sirius?" said hermione
a good pet? you won't let them kill me, ron, will you
"i let you sleep in my bed!" he said
"how dare you speak to harry?" roared black
"he would have killed me, sirius!" "then you should have died!" roared black
"no!" harry yelled
"you want to?" he said
"ah, you're awake!" she said briskly
"you haven't!" harry yelled
"but " "shh! listen! someone's coming! i think  i think it might be us!" hermione had her ear pressed against the cupboard door
"where is the beast?" came the cold voice of macnair
"harry, hurry!" she mouthed
"gotcha! get off, you stinking cat " "there's sirius!" said harry
"you think you saw his ghost?" "i don't know
"quick! where are we going to go? where are we going to hide? the dementors wilt be coming any moment " "back to hagrid's!" harry said
"that was really close!" she said to harry
"where are you? dad, come on " but no one came
"did anyone see you?" "yes, haven't you been listening? i saw me but i thought i was my dad! it's okay!" "harry, i can't believe it
"macnair!" said harry
"he's not the only one!" puffed fudge
"harry? why are we in here? where's sirius? where's lupin? what's going on?" harry and hermione looked at each other
"what?" said harry quickly
"er  stranger than usual, you mean?" "yes
"see! i told you it was from him!" "yes, but he hadn't jinxed it, had he?" said ron
"what do you reckon?" ron asked the cat
"is that right?" said frank roughly
"so - can i go then?" he asked
"what does she mean, 'the normal way'?" he spat
"they're late!" he snarled at harry
"damn!" said mr. weasley's voice
"harry, go! just go!" mr. weasley shouted, his wand on uncle vernon
"that wasn't funny fred!" he shouted
"that's not the point!" raged mr. weasley
"what are you working on?" said harry
"one of their fake wands again!" she shouted
really, bill, what do they say at the bank?" "mum,
"er - splinched?" said harry
"oh a fine way to spend six months!" she shrieked
"harry? harry potter?" "er - yeah," said harry
"not on duty, eh? it's all right for some
"would you be mr. roberts?" "aye, i would," said mr. roberts
just the one night?" "that's it," said mr. weasley
"you'll be paying now, then?" said mr. roberts
"who d'you reckon they are?" he said
"oh is that what they're after?" said bagman
"glad! don't know when i've had more fun
"see you all later!" he said
"how is he?" said harry
"why not?" said harry
"paying?" said harry blankly
"and it's mullet! troy! moran! dimitrov! back to mullet! troy! levski! moran!" it was quidditch as harry had never seen it played before
"fool!" moaned mr. weasley
"lynch is!" yelled harry
"s' matter?" he said
"you watch your mouth!" shouted ron
"sorry?" said harry
"no, you're not!" yelled his friend
"what?" "at the campsite
"hello?" called harry
"who's there?" he called again
"what did you want to attack us for?" "do not lie, sir!" shouted mr. crouch
"yes! we got them! there's someone here! unconscious! it's - but - blimey
"what?" said mr. weasley
"who did it? did you get them? barry! what's going on?" mr. crouch had returned empty-handed
"where have you been, barty?" said bagman
"winky? conjure the dark mark? she wouldn't know how! she'd need a wand, for a start!" "and she had one," said mr. diggory
i is just picking it up, sir! i is not making the dark mark, sir, i is not knowing how!" "it wasn't her!" said hermione
"you see, amos?" said mr. weasley
"dad, what's going on?" he called through the dark
"did you get them, dad?" said bill sharply
"harry's wand?" said fred
"death eaters?" said harry
i don't reckon he'd be over-pleased with them, do you?" "so.
"now look here, hermione!" said percy
"why couldn't i have some like that?" "because
"why?" said fred keenly
"a bit of what?" said ron
now, behave, won't you? won't you, fred? and you, george?" the pistons hissed loudly and the train began to move
"er - why not?" said harry
"peeves!" yelled an angry voice
"harry, guess what? guess what, harry? my brother's starting! my brother dennis!" "er - good," said harry
"dennis! dennis! see that boy down there? the one with the black hair and glasses? see him? know who he is, dennis?" harry looked away, staring very hard at the sorting hat, now sorting emma dobbs
"i've never seen one!" said hermione
"but they get paid?" she said
"what?" harry gasped
you never know, do you?" "s'pose not
"i mean, what do they do?" asked malfoy
"er - is this the new stand on elf rights?" said ron
"what?" said ron shortly
"did he get you?" moody growled
"leave it!" moody shouted
"why not?" said hermione in surprise
"knows what?" said ron, leaning forward
"doing what?" said harry
"think it's funny, do you?" he growled
"yes?" said moody, looking at her
"why don't you come up to my office? come on
"how dare you!" said ron, in mock outrage
"yeah?" said ron in mild surprise
"s-p-e-w!" said hermione hotly
"so what?" said harry
"what's a bummer?" ron asked george
"who are the judges?" harry asked
"how d'you reckon they're coming? the train?" "i doubt it," said hermione
"it's a mast!" he said to ron and hermione
"course she is, can't see a beard, can you?" said ron
"harry potter!" he called again
"what is it?" she said
"where've you been?" harry said
"malfoy got hermione!" ron said
"yes?" said snape curtly
"ah, here he is! champion number four! in you come, harry, in you come
"a what?" said harry
"have you thought about that at all?" "well
"what about ron, though?" he said
"oh yeah?" said harry
"look, it's hagrid!" said hermione
"go!" he hissed at sirius
"who were you talking to?" he said
"what?" said cedric, looking up
"why are you telling me?" he asked
fair, isn't it?" he said to cedric
what did he need? "come on, boy
"well, there you are!" said bagman
"feeling all right, harry? anything i can get you?" "what?" said harry
"he's taking risks, this one!"
"caught on, have you?" said harry coldly
"fits, doesn't it?" he said
"want a jam tart, hermione?" said fred
did i say worst? i meant best
"what's the matter?" harry said
"d-dobby?" harry gasped
"mr. bagman is a bad wizard! a very bad wizard! my master isn't liking him, oh no, not at all!" "bagman - bad?" said harry
'never had to tell him off in four years?' she said
"that egg!" hermione hissed
"but it might take weeks to work it out!" said hermione
"who're you going with, then?" said ron
"what?" said ron, taken aback
"what?" she called back
why did he have to go red now? why? "oh!" s aid cho, and she went red too
"who're you going with?" "oh - cedric," she said
"what's up, ron?" said harry, joining them
"why did i do it?" he said wildly
"i don't know what made me do it! "what?" said harry
ha! as if! she just didn't want to go with neville
"who is it then?" said ron sharply
"ooooh - who?" she said keenly
"so what about ron?" "well
"what about them?" she said
"where is hermione?" he said again
"why didn't he come?" harry asked
"what's up with you?" she said
"eh?" said hagrid blankly
"what's up?" said harry, looking at him
"so?" harry prompted ron
"who cares?" harry said
you know that golden egg? does yours wail when you open it?" "yeah," said harry
"oh yeah?" ron yelled back
"who're you?" said ron, staring at her
"we'd have seen her in the garden!" said ron
you do want him back?" he shot at hermione
"open up!" hagrid didn't answer
"how are you? been hoping to run into you! everything going all right?" "fine, thanks," said harry
the way you got past that dragon!
"can we buy you a drink?" "er
"harry!" she said, beaming
"i'll show her! silly little girl, am i? oh, i'll get her back for this
"why don't you come in?" "oh

"hear it?" said myrtle
"hiding, are you?" he said softly
"er - professor moody, d'you think you could help me - ?" "what? oh! yes
"like what?" said moody sharply
"jus' nervous, eh?" said hagrid
"what're you two doing here?" ron asked
"what?" harry gasped
"you want to try over there!" she said, pointing
"harry, well done!" hermione cried
did it take you ages to find us?" "no
"it looks like it, doesn't it?" said hermione
"made it so far, though, hasn't he?" said ron
"what're you doing here, sirius?" he said
"i bet it was lucius malfoy!" "anyone else?" said sirius
"how d'you know?" hermione shot back
"d'you know crouch, then?" said harry
"you're kidding!" said harry
"was his son a death eater?" said harry
"what's the matter?" said harry
"wrong flavor?" "no," said ron shortly
"why didn't you tell me about the gold?" "what gold?" said harry
"forget it, all right?" said harry
"bugged?" said ron blankly
"that's right!" said bagman
"we seemply 'ave to get through the maze?" said fleur
"vosn't he a judge?" said krum, staring at mr. crouch
"you stay here with him!" harry said to krum
"move!" harry shouted at it
"viktor?" harry shouted
"should i go and get someone?" said harry
what's this rubbish, potter?' why couldn't he have just got out of the way?" "maybe he didn't want you to get there!" said ron quickly
"what, at this time?" said hermione and fred
"no, i won't!" said ron hotly
"are you mad?" said ron
"did you use the map?" harry said
"my lord!" gasped the man on the floor
"you all right?" he said
oh no, he doesn't like them, does he?
"how are you?" "fine," harry lied
"any others?" said crouch coldly
"none at all! old rookwood was a friend of my dad's
"no! mother, no! i didn't do it, i didn't do it, i didn't know! don't send me there, don't let him!" the dementors were gliding back into the room
"i'm your son!" he screamed up at crouch
"you know - you know the trial you found me in? the one with crouch's son? well
"and he trusts snape?" ron said
"it's about me, isn't it?" said harry

"you tell me how she did it!" "i've been trying!" said hermione
"are you all right?" said ron, frowning at her
"oi!" ron called after her
harry!" she bent down and kissed him on the cheek
"and the fat lady?" said bill
"what're you doing here?" "come to watch harry in the last task!" said mrs. weasley brightly
how was your exam?" "oh
"fleur?" harry yelled
"you all right? did it fall on you?" "no," harry called back, panting
"just take the cup!" "no," said cedric
"what?" "we'll take it at the same time
"on three, right?" said harry
"where are we?" he said
so how could i take him? "why
harry? you don't want me to do that again, do you?" harry didn't answer
"what did the dark lord take from you?" said moody
"he forgave them, then?" he said
"noooo!" wailed winky
"you two made up, have you?" said ron
"'arry!" he looked around
"could i have a vord?" he asked her
"what are you talking about?" said ron
"how was she doing it?" said harry at once
"how did you find out?" said ron, staring at her
"you going to tell us, then?" he said to george
"bagman?" said harry sharply
"well, what, then?" said ron
"but that was all your savings!" said ron
and you know how the idiot tried to pay the goblins back?" "how?" said harry
"so that's why he kept trying to help me win!" said harry
"well - i did win, didn't i? so he can pay you your gold!" "nope," said george, shaking his head
'what do i mean by what?' said harry coldly
'hey, big d!' dudley turned
' 'how long have you been "big d" then?' said harry
he knew dudley wasn't lying - how else would he know about cedric? ' "dad! help me, dad! he's going to kill me, dad! boo hoo!'' ' 'shut up,' said harry quietly
'shut up, dudley, i'm warning you!' ' "come and help me, dad! mum, come and help me! he's killed cedric! dad, help me! he's going to - " don't you point that thing at me!' dudley backed into the alley wall
'w-what are you d-doing? st-stop it!' 'i'm not doing anything! shut up and don't move!' 'i c-can't see! i've g-gone blind! i - ' 'i said shut up!' harry stood stock still, turning his sightless eyes left and right
'w-where are you? what are you d-do-?' 'will you shut up?' harry hissed, 'i'm trying to lis- ' but he fell silent
'this way!' harry shouted at the stag
a peck of owls 'what?' said harry blankly
'who did it, son? give us names
'cold. really cold
'open it!' harry urged her
' 'ok.' 'i am going to lock your door
wand still in your jeans? both buttocks still on? ok, let's go
you all right, 'airy?' 'yeah,' said harry
'seen old figgy since?' he asked
'i'm not sure you are!' said mrs weasley
' 'like what kind of weapon?' said harry
' 'why not?' said harry quickly
'where?' said ron quickly
'sleep all right?' 'yeah,' said harry

'a house-elf! in a muggle house! i ask you
*'i knew it!' yelled ron, punching the air
he got off' 'shut up!' roared mrs weasley
' 'what's up with you, ron?' asked fred
' 'it - what?' 'ron's prefect, not me,' harry said
'desk in the corner? yeah, i see it
'hello?' harry said
'all the t - t - time! i d - d - dream about it

'where's hagrid?' he said out loud
'he's a sweet little owl, isn't he?' 'er
' 'did it?' said harry in surprise
'was there?' said ron blankly
'you?' 'yeah, it was ok,' chuckled dean
' 'still, it won't hurt to have some new blood, will it?' said ron
you got, what was it, three owls each?' said ron
what?' harry urged him
'you don't support them, do you?' 'yeah, i do,' said cho
'can't you give it a rest?' said harry
' 'well, mr thomas?' 'well, it's like harry said, isn't it?' said dean
' 'you told her he who must not be named is back?' 'yes
' that's not too bad, then, eh?' said ron
'what are you doing?' 'er - nothing
what are you doing?' harry frowned at him
'come on, you can tell me! what are you hiding here for?' 'i'm - i'm hiding from fred and george, if you must know,' said ron
'yes, it hurts, doesn't it?' she said softly
'is he any good?' 'yeah,' said harry, 'i think so
'you didn't say - ' 'shh!' said the other two
'nearly done?' 'no,' said ron shortly
'even lower than a "d"? what on earth does "t" stand for?' '"troll",' said george promptly
'well, what can we do about that?' said ron, yawning
' 'who, then?' said harry, frowning at her
'about me what?' said harry
then he said, 'that's an idea.' 'what's an idea?' said harry
rubbing it, he said, 'yeah? what did vicky say?' 'ho ho,' said hermione in a bored voice
'er - you don't know madam bones, do you?' he asked
what about cho and you?' 'what d'you mean?' said harry quickly
'did you see it?' 'd'you reckon she knows?' 'what are we going to do?' they were all looking at harry
'what?' she pointed at the window
'where did you take her?' asked ron
'no real use?' said ron in a strained voice
' 'on duty doing what?' said ron quickly
'was it your scar?' harry nodded
' 'well, tell him about this time!' 'can't, can i?' said harry grimly
' 'yeah, how is winky?' asked harry
'you know what these remind me of?' 'no, what's that?' the death eaters' scars
'have you any idea what you've - ?' 'hem, hem
'have you seen ron?' hermione asked in a low voice
'look, drop it, will you!' harry burst out
'are they hidden?' asked ron
' 'how big are they?' asked ron in a hushed voice
'is that all?' said hermione
' 'give the what gifts?' asked harry
' 'how could you tell which one was the gurg?' asked ron
' 'and did he like the present?' asked ron
' 'and you talked to him?' 'oh yeah
' 'what did he say?' 'not much,' said hagrid
' 'what d'you mean?' said ron quickly
'how did you get out of that!' asked harry
'how did you get out of that?' asked harry
'so, what happened? did you ever get near any of the other giants?' 'what? oh
'and was he talking back to you?' 'well
"where've i - ?' 'been, yes,' she said
what was i sayin?' 'appears
'wha-?' he didn't know what to do
'how do you know?' said ron very sharply
'are you going to see her again?' 'i'll have to, won't i?' said harry
'should we call someone?' 'harry! harry!' he had to tell ron, it was very important that he tell him
is it true their father's dying?' 'out!' roared a second voice
'is mum here?' said fred, turning to sirius
'sirius, i .
' 'why can't they take them off, dad?' asked fred
'go on, harry, take it! you saved dad's life
'what is it?' ' "stay where you are
'will you please come out? i want to talk to you

'what is it?' harry asked
'had a good christmas?' asked cho
'get up!' said snape sharply
'harry? harry!' someone had hit him around the face
'what do you mean?' said hermione
'you really miss it, don't you?' said cho
'is that a crime now?' said fred loudly
' 'what?' he said, taken aback
' 'no - that's your job, isn't it?' harry shot at him
'let's try again, shall we?' said snape
?' that would be mine,' said a deep voice
' 'how is she?' asked harry
'there are more of you?' she said, stunned
'trip jinx, potter!' he said
you don t know why you are here?' 'no, i don't,' said harry
s needs you!' 'enough of this rubbish!' said fudge, pulling out his own wand
'where is he?' 'i don't know!' shouted kingsley, also leaping to his feet
'what do you mean, "tried"?' said ron quickly
'what would you like to drink?' 'what? said harry, quite sure he had misheard her
'do you want sugar?' 'no,' said harry
'i wasn't going to!' she shouted
'well, draco, what is it?' asked snape
'hey, evans!' but she didn't look back
'what's the point?' he said dully
'harry, i'm talking to you, can you hear me?' 'huh?' he looked round
'are you all right? do you need help?' 'no,' said harry, 'it's nothing like that
'did i ever tell you to lay off snape?' he said
'even snape?' said harry
'oh, harry, you didn't!' she said
'and they're off!' said lee

' 'you mean umbridge?' said harry
'by yourself?' 'course i did, couldn't stand by an' watch 'em kill 'im, cou!d i?' said hagrid

''no?' said hermione in a hushed voice
'but ron, we didn't want to leave - we had to!' 'yeah?' said ron, whose face was growing rather red
'how come?' 'it was hagrid,' said harry
?' teach him english, yeah,' said harry
' 'dragon claw does work!' said ron
'shall we go and have a closer look?' said ron
'it is not good!' said hermione hotly
' 'but - but where? how?' said hermione, whose face was white
'how're we going to get there?' he asked them
is that what you think this is? you reckon i want to act the hero again?' 'no, no, no!' said hermione, looking aghast
'sirius?' he shouted
'what is padfoot? where what is hidden? what does he mean, snape?' snape looked round at harry
' 'it was you?' gasped harry
'what was it you wanted to tell him?' 'we
and we'll take potter, loo, shall we? get up, now
'where do we go, then, harry?' ron asked
'are they fish?' breathed ginny
'bound to be!' 'get out of the way!' said hermione sharply
'harry?' ron called
'my name?' said harry blankly
'stand aside!' said a rough voice
'ginny? luna?' 'harry!' hermione screamed
'what did you come after me for, then? i thought you were here to avenge my dear cousin!' 'i am!' shouted harry, and a score of ghostly harry's seemed to chorus i am! i am! i am! all around the room
'he can't hear you from here!' 'can't i, potter?' said a high, cold voice
' 'he - he sent me on purpose?' 'oh yes
' 'how?' said harry blankly
' 'how do you know all this?' harry said
and laughed?' he croaked
'what about snape?' harry spat
'you do not see the flaw in the plan yet? no
' 'then - it might not be me?' said harry
' 'why did he do it, then?' said harry, who felt numb and cold
' who?' 'sirius black,' said nick
'gone on where? listen - what happens when you die, anyway? where do you go? why doesn't everyone come back? why isn't this place full of ghosts? why - ?' 'i cannot answer,' said nick

"he's still a bit scary, isn't he?" "come off it, you've ridden him, haven't you?" said ron
"missing him? but you're okay here with hagrid, aren't you?" "oi!" said a loud voice

"well?" she said sharply
"you will?" said harry, startled
"is that like 'doctor'? what are you here for? did she get you in to have a look at me?" he was pointing at the door through which mrs. cole had just left
"who are you?" "i have told you
