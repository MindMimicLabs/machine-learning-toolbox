shooting stars all over britain? owls flying by daylight? mysterious people in cloaks all over the place? and a whisper, a whisper about the potters
"all day? when you could have been celebrating? i must have passed a dozen feasts and parties on my way here
"are you up yet?" she demanded
"want to come upstairs and practice?" "no, thanks," said harry
"let me see it!" demanded dudley
was that the sea, slapping hard on the rock like that? and (two minutes to go) what was that funny crunching noise? was the rock crumbling into the sea? one minute to go and he'd be eleven
"stop!" he commanded
"why would you be mad to try and rob gringotts?" harry asked
"you'd like one?" "wanted one ever since i was a kid  here we go
"did you hear that? he remembers me!" harry shook hands again and again  doris crockford kept coming back for more
"hello," said the boy, "hogwarts, too?" "yes," said harry
"honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? cara you tell i'm george?" "sorry, george, dear
"oy, fred! c'mere and help!" with the twins' help, harry's trunk was at last tucked away in a corner of the compartment
"so this is dumbledore!" said harry
"really? what happened to them?" "nothing, that's why it's such big news
a test? in front of the whole school? but he didn't know any magic yet  what on earth would he have to do? he hadn't expected something like this the moment they arrived
"ickle firsties! what fun!" he swooped suddenly at them
"wearing the glasses?" "did you see his face?" "did you see his scar?" whispers followed harry from the moment he left his dormitory the next day
had hagrid collected that package just in time? where was it now? and did hagrid know something about snape that he didn't want to tell harry?
"give it here," harry called, "or i'll knock you off that broom!" "oh, yeah?" said malfoy, trying to sneer, but looking worried
"harry potter!" his heart sank faster than he'd just dived
"this is it!" ron moaned, as they pushed helplessly at the door, "we're done for! this is the end!" they could hear footsteps, filch running as fast as he could toward peeves's shouts
"get out! out!" harry left, before snape could take any more points from gryffindor
"what's the matter?" in a low whisper, harry told them what he'd seen
"neville, you can look!" ron said
"mom?" he whispered
"report him!" neville shook his head
"look -they're off ouch!" someone had poked ron in the back of the head
"dragons!" he whispered
"but what are you going to do with it when it's hatched?" said hermione
had harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? he was wrong
"all right?" "good evening, hagrid, i hope you are well?" "well enough
what was going on? where were the others? at last, a great crunching noise announced hagrid's return
"are you all right?" said the centaur, pulling harry to his feet
"how do you know ?" she spluttered
come on, hermione!" the distant music stopped
"do we  er  have to join you to get across?" the black knight nodded
"but harry  what if you-know-who's with him?" "well  i was lucky once, wasn't i?" said harry, pointing at his scar
"go!" hermione turned and walked straight through the purple fire
"snape was trying to save me?" "of course," said quirrell coolly
"what does this mirror do? how does it work? help me, master!" and to harry's horror, a voice answered, and the voice seemed to come from quirrell himself "use the boy
"you got there? you got hermione's owl?" "we must have crossed in midair
"but why couldn't quirrell touch me?" "your mother died to save you
"so what happened to you two?" said harry
percy could be heard telling the other prefects, "my brother, you know! my youngest brother! got past mcgonagall's giant chess set!" at last there was silence again
"what?" said harry, not taking his eyes off the spot where they had been
"get in here! and walk on the newspaper!" harry moved gladly into the shade of the gleaming kitchen
"upstairs! hurry!" as he passed the door to the living room, harry caught a glimpse of uncle vernon and dudley in bow ties and dinner jack ets
"may i take your coats, mr. and mrs. mason?" the creature slipped off the bed and bowed so low that the end of its long, thin nose touched the carpet
dobby clapped his hands over his bat ears and moaned, "ah, speak not the name, sir! speak not the name!" "sorry" said harry quickly
he is too important, sir!" "what terrible things?" said harry at once
"dad's home!" they hurried through the garden and back into the house
"why would anyone bother making door keys shrink?" said george
"oh, are you starting at hogwarts this year?" harry asked ginny
ah well, guests first! after you, harry dear!" and she offered him the flowerpot
wanted to arrive with a bang, did we, boys?" "no, sir, it was the barrier at king's cross, it -" "silence!" said snape coldly
just calm down, all right? plenty of time for all that when you're older
"what makes you say that?" said wood testily
"can you hold him still, harry?" "get out of the way, colin!" said harry angrily
"what?" she said sulkily
"don't mind nick!" shouted sir patrick's head from the floor
"harry, what was that all about?" said ron, wiping sweat off his face
"enemies of the heir, beware! you'll be next, mudbloods!" it was draco malfoy
"he knows i'm a squib!" he finished
"what were you -?" "just having a look around," ron shrugged
"if you're talking about malfoy -" "of course i am!" said ron
think about it! we could change into three of the slytherins
"face your partners!" called lockhart, back on the platform
"how about malfoy and potter?" said snape with a twisted smile
"just do what i did, harry!" "what, drop my wand?" but lockhart wasn't listening
`a parselmouth!" said ron
" "i didn't chase it at him!" harry said, his voice shaking with anger
surely it couldn't hurt if he took the hat down and tried it on again? just to see
"now what?" ron whispered
"don't you think it's funny?" "ha, ha," said harry bleakly
"i mean, it'd just go right through you, wouldn't it?" he had said the wrong thing
who was it last time?" "i can show you, if you like, "came riddle's reply
"it wasn't him!" roared the boy, his voice echoing in the dark passage
"i don't suppose either of you can explain this? it was on the floor next to them
wouldn't be doing my duty -" "take me?" said hagrid, who was trembling
"who is it?" said madam hooch, who had sunk, weak-kneed, into a chair
"what do you want this time?" "to ask you how you died," said harry
"boys, what good will it do?" harry jabbed him in the back with his wand
how did you survive? tell me everything
a gleaming silver sword had appeared inside the hat, its handle glittering with rubies the size of eggs. "kill the boy! leave the bird! the boy is behind you
"are you crazy? all those times i could've died, and i didn't manage it? they'll be furious
"hello? hello? can you hear me? i  want  to  talk  to  harry  potter!" ron was yelling so loudly that uncle vernon jumped and held the receiver a foot away from his ear, staring at it with an expression of mingled fury and alarm
"more brandy!" yelled uncle vernon, who had gone very white
"come back and put her right!" but a reckless rage had come over harry
'orrible, eh? an' you know what black did then?" stan continued in a dramatic whisper
running away from your aunt and uncle's house like that! i'd started to think
"okay," said harry slowly, "but why?" "don't want to lose you again, do we?" said fudge with a hearty laugh
"what's that? oh, you've heard  well, no, not yet, but it's only a matter of time
he held out his hand and harry, shaking it, had a sudden idea. "er  minister? can i ask you something?" "certainly," said fudge with a smile
"stop it! stop it!" cried the manager, poking the walking stick through the bars and knocking the books apart
"anything else?" he said
"so why're we stopping?" the train was getting slower and slower
"quiet!" said a hoarse voice suddenly
"all right, you three?" hagrid yelled over the heads of the crowd
villains are these, that trespass upon my private lands! come i
you don't know the way, do you?" "a quest!" the knight's rage seemed to vanish instantly
"the giant, spectral dog that haunts churchyards! my dear boy, it is an omen  the worst omen  of death!" harry's stomach lurched
"let you have a clear field, all right? i'll call the next person forward
"he's skin and bone! you keep that cat away from him!" "crookshanks doesn't understand it's wrong!" said hermione, her voice shaking
"you know what day it is?" "er " "the sixteenth of october! 'that thing you're dreading, it will happen on the sixteenth of october!' remember? she was right, she was right!" the whole class was gathered around lavender now
"what's hogsmeade like? where did you go?" by the sound of it  everywhere
"i believe i told you to sit down?" but harry stayed where he was
"i called for time-out!" wood roared at his team
"i've had an idea, harry! give me your glasses, quick!" he handed them to her, and as the team watched in amazement, hermione tapped them with her wand and said, "impervius!" "there!" she said, handing them back to harry
"harry, behind you!" harry looked wildly around
"er " "what?" said harry, looking from one to the other
i suppose they were the reason you fell?" "yes," said harry
why? why do they affect me like that? am i just ?" "it has nothing to do with weakness," said professor lupin sharply, as though he had read harry's mind
"and what do i need with a bit of old parchment?" said harry
"and you know how to work it?" "oh yes," said fred, smirking
"what are you doing here? how  how did you ?" "wow!" said ron, looking very impressed, "you've learned to apparate!" "'course i haven't," said harry
"and the jelly slugs? and the acid pops? fred gave me one of those when i was seven  it burnt a hole right through my tongue
an' yeh know what i did? i comforted the murderin' traitor!" hagrid roared
"gone! it's the first day of the holidays, remember?" said ron, watching harry closely
"but you were innocent!" said hermione
sit down, sit down!" harry, ron, and hermione sat down side by side at the end of the table
"jinxed? how could it be jinxed?" "sirius black" harry said wearily
"i'll have one more go! i'm not thinking of happy enough things, that's what it is
yes, i'm coming, penny!" and-he bustled off to join her in a piece of toast
"sure you can manage that broom, potter?" said a cold, drawling voice
"an unworthy trick!" she was shouting
"i was just telling them all to get back to bed! my brother ron here had a nightmare " "it wasn't a nightmare!" ron yelled
i haven't done it either!" "er  hang on  yeah, i forgot, i finished it last night!" "great, you can help me!" said neville, his round face anxious
"he -brought them back from hogsmeade last time " "indeed? and you've been carrying them around ever since? how very touching
"reveal your secret!" he said, touching the wand to the parchment
"where's hermione gone?" harry looked around too
where had they gone? a loud snore told him ron had fallen asleep again
"that will do!" shrieked madam hooch, zooming between then
"just had an exam, i expect? nearly finished?" "yes," said harry
"are you quite sure, dear? you don't see it writhing on the ground, perhaps, and a shadowy figure raising an axe behind it?" "no!" said harry, starting to feel slightly sick
"no cats! there's nothing here to hurt you!" hagrid suddenly stood up, his eyes fixed on the window
"it's bad enough without you lot in trouble an' all!" they had no choice
"i knew he'd come after me! i knew he'd be back for me! i've been waiting for this for twelve years!" "you knew sirius was going to break out of azkaban?" said lupin, his brow furrowed
"voldemort, teach me tricks?" he said
you always liked big friends who'd look after you, didn't you? it used to be us
"you'd been passing information to him for a year before lily and james died! you were his spy!" "he  he was taking over everywhere!" gasped pettigrew
"what did he do to him?" hermione whispered
"where is the beast?" "it was tied here!" said the executioner furiously
"right after we'd gone down into the passage!" said hermione
"how do you expect to find a rat in the dark?" snapped hermione
"there's nothing we can do! we came back to help sirius; we're not supposed to be doing anything else!" "all right!" the moon slid out from behind its cloud
"what did you do?" she said fiercely
"you said you were only going to keep a lookout!" "i just saved all our lives
"d' you reckon he's up there yet?" said harry, checking his watch
"well?" he said quietly
"we did it!" said harry breathlessly
"out with it, potter!" he bellowed
"what  what happened?" he groaned
"beaky! he escaped! he's free! bin celebratin' all night!" "that's wonderful!" said hermione, giving ron a reproving look because he looked as though he was close to laughing
"blimey, haven' yeh heard?" said hagrid, his smile fading a little
"why?" "leavin', isn' he?" said hagrid, looking surprised that harry had to ask
"keep him?" he said uncertainly
"frank!" cried several people
"r-really, my lord? what  ?" wormtail sounded terrified again
"you heard everything, muggle?" said the cold voice
can i go now, then? only i've got a letter to sirius i want to finish
"can you take this to sirius for me?" he said, picking up his letter
"wait a moment!" he bellowed at the fire
"yeah, someone might slip dragon dung in it again, eh, perce?" said fred
"this one's a - a - a ten? ah yes, i see the little number on it now
"i expect you'll both be glad when this is over?" said mr. weasley
but would it be good enough? "harry, what are you doing?" said hermione's voice from a long way off
"honestly!" she said
"look at the referee!" she said, giggling
"who's that?" he said, blinking down at them, trying to make out their faces
"why were you asking if hedwig had come, harry?" hermione asked
"you've got to have dress robes, they're on your list! i got some for harry too
'are you going to enter?' malfoy repeated
"so!" said dumbledore, smiling around at them all
"be cool to enter, wouldn't it? but i s'pose they might want someone older
"on'y jus' hatched," said hagrid proudly, "so yeh'll be able ter raise 'em yerselves! thought we'd make a bit of a project of it!" "and why would we want to raise them?" said a cold voice
"ouch!" yelled dean thomas after about ten minutes
"what?" harry looked around; the whole class was staring at him
"a picture of your parents outside their house - if you can call it a house! your mother could do with losing a bit of weight, couldn't she?" ron was shaking with fury
why hadn't he kept his mouth shut? a few seconds' pain and he'd had to blab
jump! now! the next thing harry felt was considerable pain
lessons will end half an hour early  "brilliant!" said harry
"how, then? broomsticks?" harry suggested, looking up at the starry sky
"why's filch putting out four chairs, who else is coming?" "eh?" said ron vaguely
"don' yeh like it?" "is that aftershave?" said hermione in a slightly choked voice
"hagrid?" "and what's with the hair and the suit?" said harry in an undertone
"look!" said ron suddenly, pointing out of the window
"so do i!" said hermione breathlessly
"harry! up here, if you please!" "go on," hermione whispered, giving harry a slight push
"we're playing against each other again!" "i s'pose," said harry
to see him make a fool of himself? well, they were likely to get their wish
but to get him killed? was moody just being his usual paranoid self? couldn't someone have put harry's name in the goblet as a trick, a practical joke? did anyone really want him dead? harry was able to answer that at once
"whose owl am i going to use?" harry said as they climbed the stairs
"excited? nervous?" "i haven't really thought
"how do you think they'd feel if they knew you were competing in the triwizard tournament? proud? worried? angry?" harry was feeling really annoyed now
hornbeam and dragon heartstring?" he shot at krum, who nodded
"i wonder what he's up to? i don't know whether you should go, harry
said hagrid, "so it's one fer each o' the champions, is it? what've they gotta do - fight 'em?" "just get past them, i think," said charlie
"what?" said harry, feeling his spirits slip a further few notches
"karkaroff's trying to kill me? but - why?" sirius hesitated
"just thought you'd come nosing around, did you?" harry shouted
what are you best at?" harry tried to concentrate
"good lord, i've got to run!" said bagman in alarm, and he hurried off
"you're tied in first place, harry! you and krum!" said charlie weasley, hurrying to meet them as they set off back toward the school
"don't apologize for bothering me! i'll just hang here, wide open, until you get back, shall i?" "yeah, thanks!" ron shouted over his shoulder
'where is there enough work for two house-elves?' says winky
oh what is they saying if they knew winky was freed? oh the shame, the shame!" she buried her face in her skirt again and bawled
"you coming to this ball thing on christmas day, hagrid?" said ron
"er - cho? could i have a word with you?" giggling should be made illegal
"d'you - d'you want to go to the ball with me?" said harry
"why weren't you two at dinner?" she said, coming over to join them
"well - you can come with one of us!" "no, i can't," snapped hermione
"you're joking, weasley!" said malfoy, behind them
"want a game of chess, harry?" "yeah, okay," said harry
presents!" said seamus, spotting the large pile at the foot of his bed
"and what's that supposed to mean?" "obvious, isn't it? he's karkaroff's student, isn't he? he knows who you hang around with
"it's about winning!" people were starting to stare at them
"i hope my brothers weren't bothering you, mr. bagman?" said percy at once
what about you? which side you got it on?" but madame maxime had suddenly got to her feet
"about hagrid being half-giant?" "no," harry said, shrugging
"how did she find out?" he whispered
"well, thanks," said harry, "but i think i'm nearly there with the egg .
"there's nothing wrong with him!" the whole pub had gone very quiet
"hagrid!" hermione shouted, pounding on his front door
"hagrid, that's enough! we know you're in there! nobody cares if your mum was a giantess, hagrid! you can't let that foul skeeter woman do this to you! hagrid, get out here, you're just being -" the door opened
"of course we still want to know you!" harry said, staring at hagrid
"what's he want to know about the next hogsmeade weekend for?" said ron
they've got ron?" "the thing harry potter will miss most, sir!" squeaked dobby
where were the other champions? would he have time to take ron to the surface and come back down for hermione and the others? would he be able to find them again? he looked down at his watch to see how much time was left - it had stopped working
"you did it, you found out how all by yourself!" "well -" said harry
why hadn't he just grabbed ron and gone? he would have been first back
potter, what's ailing you now? 'a boy like no other, perhaps
"try us, why don't you?" a grin flashed across sirius's thin face
"i don't want you lot sneaking out of school to see me, all right? just send notes to me here
who's missin? where's hermione?" "she had to go to the hospital wing," said ron
"do you know if anybody else saw mr. crouch?" "no," said harry
"what's going on?" "i vos attacked!" said krum, sitting up now and rubbing his head
"what were yeh doin', wanderin' off with ruddy krum? he's from durmstrang, harry! coulda jinxed yeh right there, couldn he? hasn' moody taught yeh nothin'? 'magine lettin him lure yeh off on yer own -" "krum's all right!" said harry as they climbed the steps into the entrance hall
potter? a premonition? an apparition? what did you see?" "nothing," harry lied
"yes!" said karkaroff
but - there wouldn't have been anything to see, would there? i mean, he hasn't got a body, has he? but
"you all right?" said bill, grinning at harry and shaking his hand
"reducio!" he said
"are you all right?" harry said roughly, grabbing cedric's arm
so will you move, please?" said harry, knowing what the answer was going to be
you ask for forgiveness? i do not forgive
you know that, don't you?" "yes, master," moaned wormtail, "please
harry?" the man asked at last as he lifted harry up the stone steps
"the dark lord got his body back? he's returned?" "and the death eaters came
"the death eaters who went free? the ones who escaped azkaban?" "what?" said harry
"why he killed them? well, that's no mystery, is it?" blustered fudge
"you admit that he has been having these pains, then?" said fudge quickly
"you've picked the losing side, potter! i warned you! i told you you ought to choose your company more carefully, remember? when we met on the train, first day at hogwarts? i told you not to hang around with riffraff like this!" he jerked his head at ron and hermione
'put - it - away!' uncle vernon snarled into harry's ear
'why were you lurking under our window?' 'yes - yes, good point, petunia! what were you doing under our window, boy?' 'listening to the news,' said harry in a resigned voice
'get your fat bottom off the ground, quick!' 'you know dumbledore?' said harry, staring at her
'blimey, i - ' 'and you off buying stolen cauldrons! didn't i tell you not to go? didn't i?' 'i - well, i -' mundungus looked deeply uncomfortable
'it wasn't me! it was a couple of dementors!' 'a couple of - what's this codswallop?' 'de - men - tors,' said harry slowly and clearly
'kiss you?' 'it's what they call it when they suck the soul out of your mouth
'what's that? who must have sent them?' 'lord voldemort,' said harry
'what is this?' uncle vernon said hoarsely
'about time!' harry snarled, as she landed lightly on top of her cage
'soon?' 'almost at once,' said lupin, 'we're just waiting for the all-clear
' 'who's in it?' said harry coming to a halt with his hands in his pockets
'well?' he demanded, looking from one to the other
' 'snape!' said harry quickly
'what are you talking about?' harry asked, looking around at them all
'is that normal, hermione?' 'well - well, if he is a bit strange, it's not his fault
'hasn't anyone told you? this was my parents' house,' said sirius
'arthur!' said mrs weasley rounding on her husband
'fine!' shouted mrs weasley
'how come he's stopped killing people?' harry asked
'so, what's the order been doing?' said harry, looking around at them all
'what're you doing that for?' 'kreacher,' said ron as he turned off the light
"yes, we can!' said mrs figg indignantly
anything else?' 'yes,' said mrs figg
' 'so, what will you have to do about the toilet?' harry asked, grinning
'what d'you mean?' harry asked, jumping down beside them
' 'w-what do you mean?' said ron, looking as though he did not dare believe his ears
little ronnie, a prefect! and don't forget to pack your trunks
'oh - oh - oh!' gulped mrs weasley, and she broke into a storm of crying, her face in her hands
'shall we go and find a compartment, then?' harry asked
' said ginny, 'is it ok if we take these seats?' the girl beside the window looked up
backside!' she choked, holding her ribs
why, then, could harry suddenly see them, and why could ron not? 'are you coming or what?' said ron beside him
'what are you asking me for?' harry retorted
'why aren't you in class?' 'i've been sent to see you,' said harry stiffly
"is this true?' 'is what true?' harry asked, rather more aggressively than he had intended
' 'got to you? you can't let her get away with this!' 'i don't know how much power mcgonagall's got over her,' said harry
'why not?' 'he's got enough on his mind,' said harry, but that was not the true reason
good about ron, isn't it?' she said blearily
'hey has gryffindor got a new keeper yet?' she asked
'you saw him - ?' that's right, i saw him,' she said fiercely
'i wonder why he thought you were, then?' she said as she carried the owl to the window
' what?' said ron, looking alarmed
'just for trying to get through a door!' 'don't be silly, it wasn't just for trying to get through a door
'hey, potter, how's your scar feeling?' called malfoy
'she's not letting us use magic at all!' 'all we do is read the stupid textbook,' said ron
it's outrageous!' 'i know it is,' said harry
'you lot had an inspected lesson yet?' fred asked them
'what for?' said harry angrily
'harry,' she said timidly, 'don't you see? this
'please?' harry could not think of anything to say
'he said he was tipped off you were ordering dungbombs? but who tipped him off?' 'i dunno,' said harry, shrugging
'where are we going, anyway?' harry asked
'who are you?' said ron, rather rudely
'i'm sorry, but where's the proof of that?' snapped hermione
anyway, why were you trying to get in there?' to see you - look at this!' said ron, dragging her over to the noticeboard
'we have to go and ask permission to re-form the gryffindor team!' 'what?' said harry
'what?' said harry, looking from ron to hermione and back again
what if someone had tried to intercept hedwig? i mean, she's never been hurt on a flight before, has she?' 'who's the letter from, anyway?' asked ron, taking the note from harry
'"same time, same place?" does he mean the fire in the common room?' 'obviously,' said hermione, also reading the note
'but i kept my temper!' said harry, horrified
'how did you know about that?' harry demanded
now staring at her own hands, she said, 'do you honestly trust his judgement?' 'yes, i do!' said harry at once
since he's been cooped up in grimmauld place? you don't think he's
living through us?' 'what d'you mean, "living through us"?' harry retorted
'what's up?' said several voices
'whozair?' said harry, sitting upright in his chair
'we could go now, if you like!' for a moment harry was tempted to go with dobby
'what, hermione?' 'i think we ought to elect a leader,' said hermione
'leave it!' said angelina at once, taking fred by the arm
'i've never seen behaviour like it - back up to the castle, both of you, and straight to your head of house's office! go! now
'in!' she said furiously, pointing to the door
'under that cloak, are yeh? well, get in, get in!' 'i'm sorry!' hermione gasped, as the three of them squeezed past hagrid into the house and pulled the cloak off themselves so he could see them
'so you have been to look for giants?' said harry, grinning as he sat down at the table
'go on!' said harry urgently
' 'what do you give a giant?' asked ron eagerly
'dumbledore was relyin' on us!' 'but you've just said there was no way you could go back!' 'not by daylight we couldn', no
'dumbledore was relyin' on us!' 'but you've just said there was no way you could go back!' 'not by daylight we couldn', no
'macnair, remember him? bloke they sent ter kill buckbeak? maniac, he is
'you can see the thestrals, longbottom, can you?' she said
'who did you see die?' she asked, her tone indifferent
'we've got another seeker!' 'who?' said harry quickly
'is it cho?' she asked in a businesslike way
'well?' he demanded
'well?' ron said finally, looking up at harry
' 'krum?' 'how many other viktors do we know?' ron said nothing, but looked disgruntled
or was she lying in bed, still crying about cedric? he did not know what to think
'i'm not lying and i'm not mad!' harry told her, his voice rising to a shout
'he's our dad!' 'and how are you going to explain how you knew arthur was attacked before the hospital even let his wife know?' 'what does that matter?' said george hotly
this is how it is - this is why you're not in the order - you don't understand - there are things worth dying for!' 'easy for you to say, stuck here!' bellowed fred
it's odd, isn't it? useful, though
'are they doctors?' he asked ron quietly
'doctors?' said ron, looking startled
the weapon? the thing you-know-who's after?' 'george, be quiet!' snapped mrs weasley
'ok, go!' fred whispered
' 'i haven't moved!' said harry, his hand still upon the doorknob
' 'why?' said harry eagerly, dropping the end of his trunk
what if it happened again? he was sinking into shadows
'how're you feeling?' asked hermione
'me? did i?' and then the smile reappeared upon his face so suddenly it was rather alarming
'what?' said ron, looking amazed
'who's going to be teaching me?' snape raised an eyebrow
'did you mean to produce a stinging hex?' asked snape coolly
'i told you to empty yourself of emotion!' 'yeah? well, i'm finding that hard at the moment,' harry snarled
'it's not our fault, whoever sent it to the bloke is to blame! they must be a real prat, why didn't they check what they were buying?' 'oh, come on, ron!' said hermione shakily
all right, but why?' 'i haven't got time to tell you now, i've got to answer this quickly
'are you coming?' harry asked ron, but he shook his head, looking glum
'you're early!' said hermione, moving along to give him room to sit down
'why have you got all these letters, mr potter?' she asked slowly
'when did you do this?' she asked, her voice trembling slightly
' 'a dream?' repeated snape
how many other dreams about the dark lord have you had?' 'just that one,' lied harry
'what are you waiting for?' harry bellowed
'are you ok? umbridge hasn't been asking you about the da, has she?' 'oh, no,' said cho hurriedly
'evans!' james shouted after her
'what sort of diversion is it?' asked ron
time to test our talents in the real world, d'you reckon?' asked fred
'how do you know?' said ron and hermione together
'where are we going?' 'bit further,' said hagrid over his shoulder
'harry! hermione!' yelled ron, waving the silver quidditch cup in the air and looking quite beside himself
'is that them? is that the examiners?' harry and ron whipped around on their bench
'ruddy cowards! have some o' that - an' that - ' 'oh my - ' gasped hermione
what are you yelling about?' 'never you mind,' said harry roughly
'what about lupin? mad-eye? any of them, are any of them there?' 'nobody here but kreacher!' said the elf gleefully, and turning away from harry he began to walk slowly towards the door at the end of the kitchen
'i was - trying to get my firebolt!' harry croaked
where do we go from here?' 'we need to get back up to the castle,' said hermione faintly
what've you done with umbridge?' 'she got carried away,' said harry
'oh, took!' said ginny, as they drew nearer, pointing at the very heart of the bell jar
'what is it?' ron asked, sounding unnerved
'we've got him!' yelled the death eater nearest harry
or hasn't dumbledore ever taught you how to count?' 'he's dot alone!' shouted a voice from above them
'sirius!' he had reached the floor, his breath coming in searing gasps
'protege!' the jet of red light, his own stunning spell, bounced back at him
'liar!' she shrieked, but he could hear the terror behind the anger now
or has dumbledore sent you here? oh, don't tell me
'but did you not wonder why it was not i who explained this to you? why i did not teach you occlumency? why i had not so much as looked at you for months?' harry looked up
'he's the "boy who lived" again now, though, isn't he?' said ron darkly
' 'how can you say that?' hermione demanded
'so, where've you been?' 'bin hidin' out in the mountains,' said hagrid
'wha?' said hagrid, raising a massive hand and feeling his face
'who can answer better than you?' 'i was afraid of death,' said nick softly
has anyone you known ever died?' 'yes,' said luna simply, 'my mother
narcissa!" he said, in a squeaky voice
severus oh, severus you would help him? would you look after him, see he comes to no harm?"i can try
"he's coming!"and sure enough, a moment later there was a knock on the back door
ask the question!"oh, honestly
not you as well!" said hermione bitterly
"is he talking to your mum and dad again?"nope," said ron
but it's got to come off!" squeaked hermione
"how did you do?"inot bad," said hermione in a small voice
"don't you dare talk to my mother like that, potter!" malfoy snarled
"this is brilliant!" and he and harry led the way into the shop
why don't you bring it into the shop?" "i can't," said malfoy
don't you think malfoy d like revenge?"ron looked up, blinking
"what's wrong?"your scar's not hurting again, is it?" asked ron nervously
hi, harry!" said a familiar voice from behind him
she bought me a new wand, look!"he pulled it out and showed it to harry
no point now we've got rid of umbridge, is there?" said harry, sitting down
! i learned loads with you!"i enjoyed the meetings too," said luna serenely
or would it? would neville s mother have died to save him, as lily had died for harry? surely she would
what happened to his hand?" gasped hermione
oho! 'one of my best friends is muggle-born, and she's the best in our year!' i'm assuming this is the very friend of whom you spoke, harry?"yes, sir," said harry
"pick it up!" gaunt bellowed at her
"i see it, i see it!" said ogden hastily
"sir, how exactly ?" "too late, harry! you shall hear the story another time
"you can't pos-sibly " "yeah, i can!" said harry
"i wasn't!" "oh no, of course you weren't, i forgot you were late
"always jump to the worst conclusion, don't you?" "was it?" "well
"what did you do, go back the night he died and strip the place?" snarled harry
"lemme see her!" "something's happened to her!" sobbed leanne
"are you family?" asked mrs. cole. "no, i am a teacher," said dumbledore
"you mean he's won a scholarship? how can he have done? he's never been entered for one
"the gwenog jones? captain of the holyhead harpies?" "that's right," said hermione
"are you still interested in playing chaser?" "wha ? yeah, of course!" said dean excitedly
"coffee? pumpkin juice?" "anything," said ron glumly, taking a moody bite of toast
"yes, snape was offering to help him!" said harry
what happens if you break it, then?" "you die," said ron simply
"they're not still holding stan shunpike, are they?" asked harry
"and so have you, harry!" "when, history of magic? you know full well i never listened
"you!" he bellowed
"where is marvolo?" he asked
'what have you got to show me?'harry held out his hand, the bezoar sitting on his palm
: - three!' harry spun on the spot, lost his balance and nearly fell over
'what?' 'harry, i can't stand it!' 'you can't stand what?' asked harry, now starling to feel definitely alarmed
'you insulted her, harry! you said it was a joke!' shouted ron, who was slowly turning purple in the face as all the blood rushed to his head
"i dunno," said fred, "but there must be loads of people who'd like to poison harry, mustn't there? 'the chosen one' and all that?" "so you think slughorn's a death eater?" said ginny
d'you know how much we lost by?" he asked ron through clenched teeth
|,! "well, what's your excuse for visiting this time?" she asked, bat-ring her lashes
they can't wait to get their hands on this!" she opened the lid
"whose memory is it?" he asked
what is it you're after, tom? why not try an open request for once?" voldemort sneered
"why don't you ditch her if you want to finish it?" asked harry
"anyone we know ?" asked ron, as hermione scanned the headlines
"hey you don't know where he goes, i suppose?" "no," said tonks
"and guess who i ran into up there? tonks!" "tonks?" repeated ron and hermione together, looking surprised
"yes, but for something like this?" said hermione
"shall we shall we do it, then?" the three of them stepped out into the back garden
"he made a horcrux? and that's why he didn't die when he attacked me? he had a horcrux hidden somewhere? a bit of his soul was safe?" "a bit
"of course you've got to! but not because of the prophecy! because you, yourself, will never rest until you've tried! we both know it! imagine, please, just for a moment, that you had never heard that prophecy! how would you feel about voldemort now? think!" harry watched dumbledore striding up and down in front ol him, and thought
"of course you would!" cried dumbledore
"who would have thought you knew such dark magic? who taught you that spell?" "i read about it somewhere
the book that had become a kind of guide and friend? harry could not let it happen
'but what happened? you screamed
'snape!' he said, very loudly, and fawkes gave a soft squawk behind them
"what do you think?" asked dumbledore
"so we're going to have to cross the lake to get to it?" "yes, i think so
"can you hear me?" dumbledore did not answer
' 'it has been in it!' said malfoy vehemently
' 'my options!' said malfoy loudly
think your little jokes'll help you on your death bed, then?' she jeered
"snape killed? what're yeh on abou', harry?"dumbledore," said harry
had they taken dumbledore's body from the foot of the tower yet? what would happen to it next? where would it rest? he clenched his fists tighdy in his pockets
"what do i care how he looks? i am good-looking enough for both of us, i theenk! all these scars show is zat my husband is brave! and i shall do zat!" she added fiercely, pushing mrs. weasley aside and snatching the ointment from her
"well said indeed! our students should pay tribute, it is fitting
she was snape's mother!' t thought she wasn't much of a looker,' said ron
where are they going to hide the boy next?"at the home of one of the order," said snape
off with some of our lot?"hestia looked outraged
turns out he was grateful after all, can you believe it?
you got married?" harry yelped, looking from her to lupin
"but this is mad, there's no need c "no need!" snarled moody
hagrid! no! let me!"reparo!"there was a deafening bang and the sidecar broke away from the bike completely
hagrid!" harry called, holding on to the bike for dear life
you!" he shouted, and he thrust his hand into his pocket, but it was empty
but what happened to you, remus? where's george?"he lost an ear," said lupin
lost an c?" repeated hermione in a high voice
wait?" said bill, "not unless you'd rather the death eaters took it?"nobody spoke
"you sought to help potter, to help him escape me!"i swear i did not
no news about mad-eye?" harry asked bill
maman!" cried fleur, rushing forward to embrace her
mum's getting edgy."they all looked over at mrs. weasley
"us?" said ron, sounding surprised
why he couldn't have given us a hint when he was alive?" asked ron
unless he thought it was obvious?"thought wrong, then, didn't he?" said ron
"i wasn't going to try too hard in front of scrimgeour was i?"what do you mean?" asked hermione
oh come on! all the old kids' stories are supposed to be beedle's aren't they? 'the fountain of fair fortune'
my dear boy! arthur told me you were here, disguised
oh, i wish they'd shut up!"all right, darling?" the drunkest of the men on the other pavement was yelling
"look, this will do, in here!"it was a small and shabby all-night caf
not to stay there, but to find out what's going on!"we know what's going on! voldemort's taken over the ministry, what else do we need to know?"okay, okay, it was just an idea!"they relapsed into a prickly silence
"how did they find us? what are we going to do?"somehow her panic seemed to clear harry's head
"what was that supposed to do?"it did what i meant it to do!" said hermione rather crossly
it seems incredible that dumbledore c what?"harry? harry? harry!"i'm here!" he called, "what's happened?"there was a clatter of footsteps outside the door, and hermione burst inside
is that it, then? it's not here?"oh, it could still be here, but under counter-enchantments," said hermione
something wrong?" asked ron
"well, then, you did what you were told, didn't you?" said hermione kindly
so what happened when you got back?" harry asked
"what's going on? is everyone okay?"yes," said lupin, "but we're all being watched
perhaps just one more, master harry, for luck?"ron laughed
"more?" said mundungus
so you're not even going to try to shut him out?"hermione, i can't
what am i going to do?" ron asked the other two at once; he looked stricken
i'm pretty confident i'll get his job now!"he winked
you?" she whispered, gazing into his face
harry, i'm sorry, i'm so sorry!"don't be stupid, it wasn't your fault! if anything, it was mine
"no one tells me anything! blimey, you could have mentioned it!"well, we were running for our lives from the death eaters, weren't we?" said hermione
"what made you leave, ted?" continued the man
"professor black? please could we talk to you? please?"'please' always helps," said a cold, snide voice, and phineas nigellus slid into his portrait
"where have you brought me? why have you removed me from the house of my forebears?"never mind that! how did snape punish ginny, neville, and luna?" asked harry urgently
"think! where would he have left it?"not at hogwarts," said harry, resuming his pacing
who?"you know," he hesitated
harry, look!"she was pointing at the war memorial
what?"look at this!"the grave was extremely old, weathered so that harry could hardly make out the name
who is this person?" harry asked her, pushing the picture forward
remember ron? when he broke his wand, crashing the car? it was never the same again, he had to get a new one
what caused this abrupt rupture? had dumbledore come to his senses? had he told grindelwald he wanted no more part in his plans? alas, no
"stab it!"i have seen your dreams, ronald weasley, and i have seen your fears
"i thought you were new to the hallows quest! many of us questers believe that the peverells have everything c everything! c to do with the hallows!"who are the peverells?" asked ron
didn't i tell you there was no need to hurry, travers?" said a rough voice
blimey c but would it still work if dumbledore broke c?"work? work? ron, it never worked! there's no such thing as a resurrection stone!"hermione leapt to her feet, looking exasperated and angry
"hermione, it fits of its own accord! i know the sign of the deathly hallows was on that stone! gaunt said he was descended from the peverells!"a minute ago you told us you never saw the mark on the stone properly!"where'd you reckon the ring is now?" ron asked harry
"but don't you see? it all fits c"not, it doesn't," she said
but you said it, hermione! you've got to find out about them for yourself! it's a quest!"but i only said that to try and persuade you to come to the lovegoods'!" cried hermione in exasperation
and the rumors that he keeps being sighted abroad?" asked lee
"what happened to you?"stung
mean anything to you?"doh
"it isn't! it isn't me!"hermione's terrified squeak was as good as a confession
"will you summon 'im? 'ere?" said scabior, sounding awed, terrified
"draco, come here, look properly! what do you think?"harry saw draco's face up close now, right beside his father's
help us!" he yelled at it in mad desperation
harry, we want to help you!" luna whispered
"go! we'll follow, just go!"they caught hold of the elf's outstretched fingers
what was that?" shouted lucius malfoy from over their heads
"all fine!"harry could barely breathe
"after i saved your life? you owe me, wormtail!"the silver fingers slackened
did you know that it was harry who set dobby free?" she asked
"can i use it safely?"i think so
but then, let's go!" said ron urgently
there you go!" said ron quickly, before hermione could carry on
the sword is the price of my hire, take it or leave it!"griphook glared at them
there's a fake in these, isn't there? we switch them, and give him the fake
ask for his help, then double-cross him? and you wonder why goblins don't like wizards, ron?"ron's ears had turned red
all right, all right! it was the only thing i could think of! what's your solution, then?"we need to offer him something else, something just as valuable
stand still, don't move!" said hermione, clutching at ron
"did he now?" said aberforth
"nice job, i hope? pleasant? easy? sort of thing you'd expect an unqualified wizard kid to be able to do without overstretching themselves?"ron gave a rather grim laugh
is it true? did you break into gringotts? did you escape on a dragon? it's everywhere, everyone's talking about it, terry boot got beaten up by carrow for yelling about it in the great hall at dinner!"yeah, it's true," said harry
you've got to stop this!" harry told neville
"what did you call them all back for? this is insane c "we're fighting, aren't we?" said dean, taking out his fake galleon
"the message said harry was back, and we were going to fight! i'll have to get a wand, though c "you haven't got a wand c?" began seamus
"go and get flitwick! get him to open it, now!"but isn't your sister in there" asked professor mcgonagall
"a little extra wisdom never goes amiss, potter, but i hardly think it would be much use in this situation!"i only meant c do you know where it is? have you ever seen it?"seen it! nobody has seen it in living memory! long since lost, boy
she's sixteen!" shouted mrs. weasley
the gray lady, of course; but if it is ghostly services you require -?"it's got to be her c d'you know where she is?"let's see
"voice carried, didn't it? 'yet got till midnight ter gimme potter
"wasn't it absolutely brilliant? there we were, after we left, and i said to ron, even if we find the other one, how are we going to get rid of it? we still hadn't got rid of the cup! and then he thought of it! the basilisk!"what the c?"something to get rid of horcruxes," said ron simply
but how did you get in there?" he asked, staring from the fangs to ron
and then you can come back in!" he shouted after her as she ran up the steps after tonks
the house-elves, they'll all be down in the kitchen, won't they?"you mean we ought to get them fighting?" asked harry
"shall we split up and look c?"no," said hermione, getting to her feet too
harry, we're coming, just get in there!" said ron, pushing him forward
and will it really come by owl?" lily whispered
did you make that happen?"no." he looked both defiant and scared
'gryffindor, where dwell the brave at heart!' like my dad
thought we were supposed to be friends?" snape was saying, "best friends?"we are, sev, but i don't like some of the people you're hanging round with! i'm sorry, but i detest avery and mulciber! mulciber! what do you see in him, sev, he's creepy! d'you know what he tried to do to mary macdonald the other day?"lily had reached a pillar and leaned against it, looking up into the thin, sallow face
"you take a great deal for granted, dumbledore! perhaps i have changed my mind!"you gave me your word, severus
"he took your blood and rebuilt his living body with it! your blood in his veins, harry, lily's protection inside both of you! he tethered you to life while he lives!"i live
grindelwald was looking for them too?" he asked
"it was natural! you wanted to see them again
"it is over! set him down, hagrid, at my feet, where he belongs!"harry felt himself lowered onto the grass
"you mean he was weak!" screamed voldemort
can we go up?" he asked the gargoyle
